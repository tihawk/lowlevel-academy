# Creating Libraries

In our multi-module programming lesson, we learned how to write code that 
makes use of multiple C files across a single project. But what if we wanted 
to share that code across multiple projects?

## Libraries

A library is a piece of code that is portable as either a static object or a shared object.

## Static Object

A static object, static library, or `.a` file is a set of intermediate ELF files 
that are compiled into your program at compile time. The benefit of a static 
object is that the code is transported inside your final product, you don't
need to ship additional libraries. The downside is that your binary will 
increase in size as code is not shared amongst other processes.

## Compiling

```Makefile
# compiling the library
gcc -o libteehee.o -c ./lib.c
ar rcs libteehee.a libteehee.o

# adding the library to a project
gcc -o main main.c libteehee.a
```

## Shared Object

A shared object, shared library, or `.so` file is a compiled ELF file that is
linked into your program at run time. The benefit of a shared object is that
the code is transported outside your final product meaning your ELF will be
smaller without the duplicated code inside. However, this means that for your
code to run, you will need to install the library in the system root library
directory, such as `/lib` or `/usr/lib`

```Makefile
# compiling the library
gcc -o -shared libteehee.so ./lib.c

# adding the library to a project
gcc -o main main.c -lteehee -L$(pwd)/lib
```
